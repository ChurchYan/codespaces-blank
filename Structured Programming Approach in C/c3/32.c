// 32. The formula for converting centigrade temperatures to Fahrenheit is:
// F = 32 + (C * (180.0 / 100.0))
// Write a program that asks the user to enter a temperature reading in centigrade and then 
// prints the equivalent Fahrenheit value. Be sure to include at least one negative centigrade number in your test cases.
