// 39. Write a C program using printf statements to print the three first letters of your first name 
// in big blocks. This program does not read anything from the keyboard. 
// Each letter is formed using seven rows and five columns using the letter itself. 
// For example, the letter B is formed using 17 b's, as shown below as part of the initials BEF.
// ```
// BBBB   EEEEE  FFFFF
// B   B  E       F
// B   B  E       F
// BBBB   EEEE    FFF
// B   B  E       F
// B   B  E       F
// BBBB   EEEEE   F
// ```
// This is just an example. Your program must print the first three letters of your first name. 
// Design your print statements carefully to create enough blank lines at the beginning 
// and end to make your initials readable. 
// Use comments in your program to enhance readability as shown in this chapter.
