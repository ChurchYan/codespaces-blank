Once upon a time, in a small village surrounded by mountains, there lived a curious boy named Tom. Every morning, he would explore the forest, searching for new adventures. One day, he discovered a hidden path covered with colorful flowers. Following the path, Tom found a sparkling stream and a family of playful rabbits. From that day on, Tom visited the forest every morning, making new friends and learning the secrets of nature.
